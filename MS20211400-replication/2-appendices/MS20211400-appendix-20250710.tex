\subsection{Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF)}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
\noindent{\large We use our causal estimates to compute the MVPF (Hendren
and Sprung-Keyser 2020) for a policy that provides communication credit
to low-income adults for two months. The MVPF is a ratio of society’s
willingness to pay (private benefit) for this policy to the net cost
of the policy to the government (here, an ``imagined'' funder). }{\large\par}
\end{doublespace}
\begin{doublespace}

\subsubsection{{\large Society’s Willingness to Pay (MVPF numerator)}}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
\noindent{\large We estimate this to include two main components. }{\large\par}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
{\large First, is the averted (otherwise) social cost of mental health
burden, $\xi$. Mental health disorders account for 13\% of the overall
global disease burden (Collins et al. {[}2011{]}), which is likely
higher in low-income countries (\href{https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/701606?mobileUi=0}{Adhvaryu et al. [2019]});
we assume 13\%. Health expenditure per capita in Ghana is US\$78 (\href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD?locations=GH}{World Bank [2018]}).
With a treatment effect of -10\% reduced mental destress rate (or
-25\% for severe mental distress; we assume -10\%), we conservatively
estimate the averted social cost of mental health burden to be 0.10x0.13xUS\$78=+US\$1.014.
This $\xi$ estimate is very conservative: \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24526584/}{Addo et al. [2013]}
estimate that the average monthly household cost of mental healthcare
in Ghana is US\$60.24 (i.e., 2xUS\$60.24=US\$120.48 for two months),
so with a treatment effect of -10\% reduced mental destress rate and
a national average household size of 4.5 people per household, this
will imply 0.1xUS\$120.48/4.5=+US\$2.68 averted social cost, which
is 2.6 times larger. Second, is the individual beneficiary's willingness
to pay for not visiting the hospital or not getting mentally unwell,
$\eta$. This includes three sub-components: (i) out-of-pocket health
bill $\eta_{1}$ (0.10x0.13xUS\$63=+US\$0.82; out-of-pocket health
expense is US\$63 {[}\href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD?locations=GH}{World Bank 2018}{]});
(ii) travel cost to health centers $\eta_{2}$ (assumed to be 20\%
of the estimated out-of-pocket health bill = 0.2xUS\$0.82=+US\$0.203;
\href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24526584/}{Addo et al. [2013]}
suggest using 74\% for such indirect costs but we assume 20\%); and
(iii) lost income from missed work $\eta_{3}$ (assumed to be only
5\% of the average earnings of non-farm enterprises = 0.05xUS\$231=+US\$11.55
for two months; most individuals in our sample {[}around 80\%{]} operate
informal non-farm enterprises and the total average annual earnings
of non-farm enterprises is US\$1,385 in 2021 US\$ {[}\href{https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/GLSS7\%20MAIN\%20REPORT_FINAL.pdf}{Ghana Statistical Service, GLSS 7 Table 9.6]};
the treatment effects were all concentrated on individuals operating
informal enterprises, see Table \ref{tab:wellbeingXinformal_pooled_meta}).}{\large\footnote{{\large Informal non-farm business income may either be consumed in
the household (where we find no impacts) or invested (where our impacts
are concentrated given that our treatment effects were all concentrated
on individuals operating informal enterprises).}}}{\large\par}

{\large Combining all the components, the MVPF's numerator = $\xi$+$\sum_{i=1}^{3}\eta_{i}$=US\$13.590
for the average treated individual.}{\large\footnote{{\large We drop the direct value of the communication subsidy to beneficiaries
(+US\$7.0) to avoid double counting. In standard maximization models,
the willingness to pay would have just been the size of the subsidy
}{\large\textit{if}}{\large{} people are fully optimizing. Here, it
is reasonable to assume that people are not fully optimizing (see
e.g., our evidence that the installment program has larger and more
sustainable effects compared to the lumpsum, with the exception of
consumption, which may reflect either time inconsistency or social
pressure problems from receiving one-time large transfers). Given
this potential mis-optimization (the envelope theorem does not easily
apply and so the benefits the subsidy delivers to people are not already
captured by the subsidy), the willingness to pay includes the benefits
on mental health and its associated cost reductions ($\xi$ and $\eta$).}}}{\large .}{\large\par}

\subsubsection{{\large Net Cost to the \textquotedblleft imagined\textquotedblright{}
Funder / Government (MVPF denominator)}}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
\noindent{\large We estimate this to include two main components. }{\large\par}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
{\large First, is the cost of providing communication transfer for
two months, $G$ (+US\$7.0). Second, is the missed communication services
tax (CST) revenue if individuals do not communicate or stay connected,
$\mu$. In Ghana, the CST is used to finance the National Youth Employment
Programme (NYEP) ($\geq$20\% of the CST) and support other national
development activities. Using the prevailing 5\% CST rate (\href{https://gra.gov.gh/news/amendments-to-the-communications-service-tax-act-2008-act-754/}{Ghana Revenue Authority [2020]}),
we estimate that the government loses 0.05xUS\$7.0= -US\$0.35. In
computing the net cost to the government of this policy, it is important
to note that (i) communication is a network good so the ultimate economic
incidence of these communication transfers extends to other individuals:
others might benefit from receiving mobile phone calls from the treated
individual (positive externalities) but this might also create congestion
hassle or traffic on the communication network (negative externalities).
We assume (i) and (ii) to be equal. If the positive externalities
dominate, as we would expect (see \href{https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/86/3/1033/5061115?guestAccessKey=8628aed3-426d-4fc6-af39-bd5561c493a3}{Björkegren [2019]}
for an example in Rwanda), then the total cost of this policy is over-estimated
in this dimension. Further, we conservatively did not factor in the
reduced fiscal cost from less hospital visits generally due to the
reduced likelihood of mental health disorders. }{\large\par}

{\large Lastly, combining all the components, the MVPF's denominator
= $G$+$\mu$=US\$6.65 for the average treated individual. }{\large\par}
\end{doublespace}
\begin{doublespace}

\subsubsection{{\large MVPF Estimate}}
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
\noindent{\large Taking the ratio, we estimate a conservative MVPF
of providing communication credit to be $\frac{13.590}{6.650}=2.044$.
Notice that in determining the MVPF, we intentionally bias the estimates
to understate the benefits and overstate the costs. With a current
total population of about 31,732,129 in Ghana, an adult population
of 18,073,230 (57\% of the total population), and the poverty rate
of our study's sample of adults being 22\%, the policy's total benefit
will be US\$54,035,343 (=0.22x18,073,230xUS\$13.590) against a total
cost of US\$26,441,135 (=0.22x18,073,230xUS\$6.650).}{\large\par}
