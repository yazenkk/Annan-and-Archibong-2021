\noindent
Mental health disorders account for a significant share of the overall global disease burden.
 The economic losses from such disorders are staggeringly large,
 particularly in low-income countries,
 where people are faced with several unexpected shocks.
 We test whether improved communication can mitigate such mental health disorders.
 Partnering with a major telecommunications company,
 we implement low-cost communication interventions that provide mobile calling credits to a nationally representative set of low-income adults in Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Individuals’ inability to make unexpected calls,
 need to borrow SOS airtime,
 and to seek digital loans decreased significantly relative to a control group.
 As a result,
 the programs led to a significant decrease in mental distress (-9.7%),
 the likelihood of severe mental distress by -2.3 percentage points (a quarter of the mean prevalence),
 and domestic violence,
 with null impact on overall consumption expenditure.
 The effects are stronger for monthly mobile credits than a lump-sum.
 We present evidence that improvements in both business-related services and social inclusion and/or protection are relevant explanations.
 Simple cost-benefit analysis shows that providing communication credit to low-income adults is a cost-effective policy for improving mental health.
 Communication – the ability to stay connected – meaningfully improves mental well-being and interventions about communication are particularly valuable when implemented as many installments.

Imagine that you are unable to communicate – to make a phone call,
 use the web,
 access social media,
 and so on – when the need arises unexpectedly.
 Does this matter for individuals' mental and economic well-being?
 Should communication interventions during pandemics be applied as a one-time large transfer or as numerous small installments?
 How valuable or cost-effective is a policy that provides communication credit to low-income adults for improving mental health?
 We use evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic to address these important questions.

Throughout the world,
 major communication interventions were initiated in the public and private sectors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 In the United States,
 ATT Inc.
 provided free 10GB of internet data per month for 60 days as temporary relief for eligible customers to enable them to stay connected during lockdown,
 starting March 27,
 2020 (ATT Inc.
 2020).

As the leading provider of mobile services in the US,
 with about 40% share of the market,
 ATT Inc.'s initiative affected a significant number of people,
 particularly those in the low-income communities.
 Others telecommunications companies,
 such as Comcast Corporation,
 have deployed similar interventions,
 providing essential internet and mobile services without charge to low-income families,
 including seniors,
 veterans,
 and people with disabilities (Comcast Corp.
 2020).

 In Ghana,
 the government reduced the Communication Service Tax (CST) from 9% to 5%,
 which reflected a reduction in the cost of mobile talk time and data purchases,
 effective from September 15,
 2020,
 in response to the economic and social hardships induced by the pandemic (Ghana Revenue Authority 2020;

).
 The need for such communication programs was particularly crucial in developing countries where the informal sector is large and the COVID-19 crisis presented a substantial threat to individuals who face credit,
 savings,
 and psychological stressors and constraints (Banerjee,
 Niehaus,
 and Suri 2019).
 Despite the increase in these communication-based programs globally,
 there is relatively little evidence on their impacts on well-being during a pandemic.

Administrative data on mobile financial transactions from a major provider in Ghana sheds light on the potential value of communication during the pandemic.

 shows the distribution of transactions and illustrates that while the overall market activity decreased following the onset of the pandemic,
 interestingly and in contrast,
 the demand for mobile airtime-related activities (as measured by the purchase of data and airtime amounts,
 and thus their demand) sharply increased over the period.
 This descriptive evidence documents the importance of communication during the pandemic and is congruent with our baseline surveys:
 68% of individuals indicated that their need to call or connect with others (family,
 friends,
 employers) had increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its disruptions.
 Yet,
 between 52% and 62% indicated that,
 sometimes,
 when the unexpected need arises,
 they were not able to call or connect with their family and friends due to the economic hardships associated with the pandemic.
 Thus,
 programs that directly mitigate such binding communication barriers will likely have a larger impact on individual and societal well-being.

 among a nationally representative set of a sub-population of low-income households in Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 We draw on an existing nationally representative baseline frame (Ghana Living Standards Survey 7 [GLSS7]),
 and focus on 1,131 low income individuals or households that are readily reachable by phone,
 work in the informal sector,
 and are located in the bottom 75th percentile of the income distribution.
 This sample is low income,
 where income and psychological constraints (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013;
 Ridley et al.
 2020) can easily bind due to pandemic-induced economic losses,
 and spans 193 districts across the country's historical ten administrative regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We partner with a major local telecommunications company to run our experiment by randomly assigning the 1,131 individuals to two candidate communication programs:
 40GHS (US$7.0) lumpsum mobile credit (376 individuals) versus 20GHS (US$3.5) monthly installments of mobile credit over two months (371 individuals) versus a control program (384 individuals);
 and then measuring how these affect individuals' ability to mitigate unexpected communication constraints during the pandemic,
 with impacts on well-being,
 that is,
 mental health,
 domestic violence,
 and consumption expenditures.
 The different programs about communication provide a means of examining how communication programs might be delivered:
 one-time large communication transfer versus numerous small installments.

 which have potentially large short- and long-term impacts on human capital development.
 Mental health disorders account for 13% of the overall global disease burden (Collins et al.
 2011).
 The economic and productivity losses from such disorders are significant,
 particularly in low-income countries (Mathers,

 The direct economic impact of COVID-19 in these environments was high and includes earnings and consumption shortfalls (Banerjee et al.

 among many other meaningful negative impacts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
How might communication affect well-being?
 Conceptually,
 communication is a network good and could turn on at least three interesting channels:
 (i) improved business-related services (via professional networks),
 (ii) improved social inclusion and/or protection (via social networks),
 and (iii) improved informal insurance arrangements or consumption insurance (via social networks).
 First,
 professional networks operate in form of affected individuals being able to stay in touch with customers and buy/sell with vendors to increase their revenues,
 which has a positive impact on mental well-being (see e.g.,
 Ridley et al.
 2020 for a detailed review).
 Second,
 social inclusion (or reduced isolation) operates in form of individuals being able to stay in touch with friends/family who can provide them emotional support (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013;
 Leslie and Wilson 2020),
 or serve as agents of social control and protection to specifically reduce domestic violence by increasing the cost of violence (à la Gelles 1983;
 Gelles and Straus 1979).
 Third,
 in vulnerable periods such as COVID-19 related lockdowns,
 households might have difficulty communicating with their informal insurance networks (family,
 friends,
 etc.) and thus consumption risk-sharing ability may suffer (Blumenstock,
 Eagle and Fafchamps 2016;
 Jack and Suri 2016).
 The provision of mobile credit might alleviate that constraint.
 Our interventions are designed to both relax communication constraints and test their impact on mental health,
 domestic violence,
 and consumption expenditures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
We first conduct three baseline survey waves prior to the deployment of the communication interventions.
 After fielding the first round of interventions (lumpsum and first installment),
 we conducted two endline survey waves to track the various outcomes.
 Our final dataset is unique due to its size and national representativeness,
 the expansive set of outcomes,
 the administrative data on mobile financial transactions,
 and 1
\begin_inset Formula $\times$

3 random variations for communication at the individual level.
 We find five set of results:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
First,
 as a first stage,
 the interventions decreased unexpected communication constraints significantly.
 That is,
 our experimental interventions mitigate individuals' inability to meet unexpected communication needs and stay connected.
 On individuals' inability to make unexpected calls,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:mitigate_pooled_meta"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 Column 2 shows a treatment effect of -36 percentage points (pp,
 i.e.
 is -72% relative to the control group mean).
 Column 6 shows a treatment effect of -22 pp (-78%) on individuals' unexpected need to borrow airtime,
 and column 8 shows a -3.5pp (-44%) effect on an indicator for seeking digital loans.
 These effects are larger and more sustained over time for the installment communication credit program compared to the lumpsum credit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Second,
 we find a meaningful improvement in psychological well-being,
 which is measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and on domestic violence.
 Both mental distress and severe mental distress decreased by -9.7% and -2.3pp (-24%) relative to a control group,
 respectively (See Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:consumpxhealth_pooled_sep"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 Column 5).
 The installment communication credit program had larger and more sustainable effects compared to the lumpsum credit.
 Only the installment program led to a significant decrease in the likelihood of individuals threatening their partners (-9.7%,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:consumpxhealth_pooled_sep"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 Column 2).
 Overall,
 there are no impacts on the likelihood of individuals hitting their partners,
 our second measure of domestic violence (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:health_pooled_meta"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 Column 4).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Third,
 we find a null improvement in direct economic well-being.
 The provision of communication credits can free up an individual's resources that would otherwise have been allocated to communication for other consumption expenses.
 The overall effect is,
 however,
 null on total consumption,
 which is reassuring since the size and specificity of our intervention were not large enough  to meaningfully change consumption.
 Only the installment communication intervention increased consumption expenditures,
 but the size is very small economically and only in endline wave 2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Fourth,
 what explains the estimated communication impacts?
 We explore three alternative explanations:
 (i) improved business-related services,
 (ii) improved social inclusion,
 and (iii) improved informal risk-sharing or consumption insurance.
 We find strong empirical support for improvements in both business-related services (increased business-related income) and social inclusion/protection (reduced isolation),
 but not for consumption insurance.
 Treated individuals reported a significant increase in income (+8.5GHS per week overall,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:_channels-pooled"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 Column 2) from business-related services.
 Similarly,
 treated individuals were less likely to report being emotionally- and socially-tired (-31% for the lumpsum credit group relative to control and -52% for the installment credit group) but were also more likely to stay at home during the pandemic (See Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:_channels-separate"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 Columns 3 and 4).
 These results show that improvements in professional networks and social inclusion are relevant explanations.
 We also examine heterogeneity in treatment effects along four dimensions:
 poverty,
 informality,
 gender,
 and lockdown.
 The effects are indistinguishable by gender but are larger for individuals that are very poor,
 in the informal sector,
 and located inside areas which were previously in lockdown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Fifth,
 the marginal value of public funds (MVPF) (Hendren and Sprung-Keyser 2020) for a policy that provides communication credit to low-income adults is 2.04,
 suggesting that US$1.0 of spending on this communication credit policy delivers more than US$1.0 in benefits to its beneficiaries.
 We show robustness of the various findings to the post-double selection LASSO estimation procedure (Belloni et al.
 2014),
 including adjustments for multiple testing (Romano and Wolf 2005) and attrition (Lee 2009;
 Behaghel et al.
 2015).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
We contribute to three distinct literatures.
 First,
 there is almost no work connecting mental health,
 domestic violence and economic impacts of information and communications technology (ICT) (Jensen 2007).
 We offer short-run causal view of what communication does to mental health and domestic violence,
 connecting ICT,
 domestic violence and mental health.
 Allcott,
 Gentzkow,
 and Song (2022) examines how habit formation and self-control problems explain the usage of social media,
 which is different from the mental health and/or domestic violence that we evaluate.
 More recently,
 Gawai (2023) documents that broadband rollout reduces depression symptoms among older adults.

 Gelles and Straus 1979) predicts that societal controls and protection can increase the perpetrator’ costs of domestic violence and reduce its incidence.
 We implement a test that provides an empirical support for the theory to explain our communication credit impacts.

Our results have implications for policy.
 Mitigation of unexpected pandemics can be a daunting task.
 Policymakers battle on various fronts:
 tackling the spread of the pandemic while easing the potential welfare impacts of the negative income shock and constraints on individuals.
 Our programs relax binding communication constraints (individuals inability to meet unexpected communication needs and to stay connected) and allow us to provide the first experimental evidence on the impact of communication interventions from a nationally representative set of low-income individuals on overall well-being and gender relations during pandemics.
 The provision of phone credit is a cost-effective policy for improving mental health and a low-cost intervention to encourage people to remain indoors during lockdown,
 helping to reduce infection.
 Thus,
 our results add to the space of potentially resilient policy initiatives aimed at tackling pandemics (mitigating their impacts).

Our study is set in Ghana.
 Mobile phone connection penetration is very high:
 mobile cellular subscriptions were 134 per 100 people in 2019 (rising from 70 per 100 people in 2010),
 even among the poor (World Bank 2020).
 We draw on an existing nationally representative baseline frame (GLSS7) of households in Ghana,
 which is housed by the implementer of our surveys (Ghana Statistical Service [GSS]).
 We then focus on a sub-population of low-income households (i.e.,
 individuals/households located in the bottom 75th percentile of the income distribution).
 These are largely married (91%) individuals (household heads),
 with over 22% poverty rates and have mobile phone and connection access that is readily reachable by phone.
 Individuals without mobile credit can still take in-coming calls.

Similar to many countries,
 the pandemic in Ghana had economic impacts well beyond its health impacts,
 due to the restrictions on mobility and interactions that it triggered.
 Following the arrival of the first COVID-19 case in Ghana (March 03,
 2020),
 the President Nana Akufo-Addo announced a lockdown in the two most economically active regions (namely,
 the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area and the Greater Kumasi Metropolitan Area) on March 30,
 which was later followed by a nation-wide closing of all schools and a ban on other activities and which extended to these affected regions.

 was suspended.
 In terms of intracity travel,

Individuals in our baseline surveys,
 conducted in September 2020,
 are much aware of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on economic activities.
 Almost 100% of individuals indicated being aware of COVID-19 and the restrictions,
 and 79% trust the government and the media to provide accurate statistics (cases,
 deaths) of the pandemic.
 Meanwhile,
 68% of individuals reported their need to call or connect with others (family,
 friends,
 employers) has unexpectedly increased,
 yet over 52-62% were sometimes unable to connect as a result of the pandemic and its hardships.
 This is meaningful as 77% of the respondents are self-employed,
 18% are located in previously locked-down regions,
 and 80% are involved either fully or partially in the informal sector.

Measurement of Key Outcomes

\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
We define the various outcome measures:
 communication constraints-mitigation,
 mental health,
 domestic violence,
 and consumption expenditures:
 Communication constraints-(un)mitigation measures the incidence of “(un)mitigated” mobile calls and transfers – asking whether individuals were unexpectedly confronted with the need to call or connect with others (family,
 friends,
 work) but unable to do so because they 
\shape italic
lacked
\shape default
 enough communication resources to remedy the costs.
 Under such dire and unexpected situations (as it was during the pandemic),
 individuals either borrow airtime (i.e.,
 in-kind SOS credit with a service charge of 10% and fully repayable once subscribers recharge their phone accounts with an amount that is more than the outstanding SOS credit amount) or seek digital loans (i.e.,
 short-term digital but cashable loans with an interest of 6.9% over 30 days) from telecommunications providers.
 Therefore,
 we measure communication constraints-(un)mitigation also based on the incidence of borrowing airtime or seeking digital loans due to unexpected circumstances to connect with others.

Unexpected communication needs are plausibly random,
 with higher potential for more distress compared to needs that are expected.
 There is room to adjust or plan for expected needs.
 Thus,
 communication is likely more valuable to individuals when faced with unexpected needs because of the less room to adjust.

Consumption expenditures are measured across food (inside and outside home),

 Mental health is measured by the incidence of mental distress (using Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)) (psychological well-being).
 K10 values can range from 0 (minimum) to 50 (maximum),
 and values above 30 are classified as severe mental distress (Adhvaryu et al.
 2019).
 Gender relations reflect domestic violence (DV) and specifically elicit from an individual whether he/she either threatened or hit his/her partner (Banerjee et al.

 to measure additional variables:
 individuals' characteristics (poverty,

 awareness and beliefs about COVID-19,
 COVID-19 impacts and communication constraints.
 We adapted a recently developed shortcut – yet rigorous,
 inexpensive,
 simple and transparent – measure of poverty called the “Simple Poverty Scorecard” (Schreiner 2015;
 Annan JPEForthcoming).
 These variables are used to test for randomization balance and explore heterogeneity in treatment effects.

We evaluate the impacts of two communication programs:

 We use the administrative (transaction-level) data to calculate the 50th (75th) percentile purchase for airtime and data combined over the data period to be 188GHS (308GHS) per month.
 We set the total value of our communication credit intervention for each individual to 40GHS,
 that is,
 21% of the median monthly purchase,
 or equivalently,
 13% of the 75th percentile monthly purchase.
 We estimate this amount as sufficient to cover the most basic unexpected communication needs over a month or two.
 We first conduct three baseline survey waves prior to the deployment of the communication interventions,
 which include:

 There is limited effect of the lumpsum credit on severe mental distress.
 For consumption,
 the separate effects are null and indistinguishable across the two communication treatments,
 which is not surprising because of the the overall null pooled treatments effect on consumption expenditures (see Table

Interpreting the Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
How does communication affects well-being?
 We seek to understand what happens when we give mobile credit to (potentially) 
\shape italic
communication-constrained
\shape default
 individuals during unexpected hardships.
 Conceptually,
 communication is a network good and could turn on at least three interesting alternative interpretations:
 (i) improved business-related services (via professional networks),
 (ii) improved social inclusion and/or protection (via social networks),
 and (iii) improved informal risk-sharing or consumption insurance (via social networks).
 We find strong empirical support for improvements in both business-related services and social inclusion,
 but not for informal insurance networks.
 We discuss and explore these alternative explanations for the communication impacts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Professional networks operate in form of affected individuals being able to stay in touch with customers and buy/sell with vendors to increase their revenues,
 which we know has a positive impact on mental well-being (Ridley et al.
 2020).
 To measure this,
 we asked respondents about their total hours worked for income and the amount they received from business income-related activities at endline.
 Treated individuals reported (insignificant) increase in their hours worked but a very significant increase in incomes (+8.5GHS per week overall) from business-related services (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:_channels-pooled"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 This indicates that improvements in professional networks is a likely explanation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Social inclusion (reduced isolation) operates in form of individuals being able to stay in touch with friends/family who can provide them emotional (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013) and social support,
 or serve as agents of social control and protection to specifically reduce domestic violence by increasing the cost of violence (à la Gelles 1983;
 Gelles and Straus 1979).
 To measure this,
 we asked respondents about whether they were emotionally- and socially-tired of staying at home at endline.
 We find very significant evidence that treated individuals were less likely to report being emotionally- and socially-tired (-31%=-0.159/0.519 for the lumpsum credit group;
 -52%-0.265/0.519 for the installment credit group) but were also more likely to stay at home or seek shelter during the pandemic (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:_channels-separate"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 Columns 3 and 4).
 This shows that improvements in social inclusion is a meaningful,
 relevant explanation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Communication credit can improve or rejuvenate informal insurance arrangements.
 In vulnerable periods such as COVID-19 related lockdowns,
 households might have difficulty communicating with their informal insurance networks (family,
 friends) and thus consumption risk-sharing ability may suffer (Blumenstock,
 Eagle and Fafchamps 2016;
 Jack and Suri 2016).
 The provision of mobile credit might alleviate that constraint.
 We take advantage of our individual-level panel data on consumption to measure this using changes in consumption growth at endline.
 The pandemic's lockdown was a negative consumption shock (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:_consumpShock?"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

):
 individuals located in lockdown areas show a large decrease in consumption growth (median=-13%;
 mean=-45%) compared to those in non-lockdown areas (median=-8%;
 mean=-27%).
 Yet,
 we do not find evidence for an impact of mobile credit on the negative consumption effect of the lockdown (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:_channels-pooled"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 Our test on consumption insurance here (which is similar to the one in Cochrane 1991) regresses consumption growth against the negative consumption shock (ie.,
 lockdown) combined with mobile credit (i.e.,
 communication intervention).
 This result suggests that improvements in informal insurance networks,
 while plausible,
 is unlikely at play.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Finally,
 we note that the two channels we find evidence for –i.e.,
 improved business networks and social inclusion/protection – are also consistent with Béland et al.
 (2021) who used the Canadian Perspective Survey Series during the COVID-19 pandemic to document that concerns about both finances and maintaining social ties are significantly related to concerns about family stress and domestic violence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Heterogeneous Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
The analyses so far assume that the effects of the communication intervention are uniform.
 Here,
 examine heterogeneity in treatment effects along four dimensions:
 (i) poverty,
 (ii) informality,
 (iii) gender,
 and (iv) lockdown.
 The results are shown in Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:wellbeingXlockeddown_pooled_meta"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 The decrease in domestic violence is more significant for the very poor,
 while individuals in the informal sector experienced significantly larger and better mental health improvements.
 Conversely,
 females experienced slightly better mental health effects but this is not statistically significant,
 while individuals located in previously locked-down areas are more eager to re-allocate their budgets to more consumption (specifically,
 to utilities and durables,
 as expected).
 The latter reflects individuals who might still be battling the persistent economic impacts of the COVID-driven lockdowns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
The results on gender differences in domestic violence and mental health/stress are worth discussing.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:wellbeingXfemale_pooled_meta"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 indicates that females are about -12% (=(-0.14/1.16)x100) relatively less likely to hit their partner,
 but when combined with mobile credit,
 there is no significant difference in hitting a partner by gender.
 Similarly,
 when the mobile credits intervention is combined with mental health,
 we see no significant differences by gender.
 From the raw data and on a scale of 1 (never) to 4 (very often),
 men reported an average score of 1.15 hitting their partners versus females who reported an average score of 1.09 hitting their partners (
\shape italic
p
\shape default
-value=0.124 from a 
\shape italic
t
\shape default
-test of their difference).
 Mental health was equally high,
 with an average score of 14.47 for males and 14.55 for females.
 (
\shape italic
p
\shape default
-value=0.124 from a 
\shape italic
t
\shape default
-test of their difference).
 These unconditional means from the data are consistent with the coefficients on female in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:wellbeingXfemale_pooled_meta"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 Béland et al.
 (2021) show that stress and domestic violence were high during the pandemic for both men and women,
 which is consistent with summary statistics from our raw data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
We interpret the lack of gender differences in mental stress or domestic violence when combined with mobile credits within the lens our Framework on channels,
 suggesting that mobile credit,
 in our context,
 either reduces isolation and increase the cost of hitting your partner or allows you to stay in touch with your business clients,
 thereby minimizing mental stress and the potential to hit your partner if engaged in business activities.
 These results are in the right direction,
 and thus reassuring and provide corroborative support for our main findings.

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
We document the well-being impacts of providing low-cost in-kind communication transfers.
 A natural question is 
\shape italic
how does such in-kind transfers compare to cash transfers?

\shape default
 Our experiments did not include a separate treatment program for cash,
 but one can draw some insights from the ongoing large literature on cash transfers during the pandemic (see e.g.,
 Banerjee et al.
 2020).
 In rural Kenya,
 Banerjee et al.
 (2020) examined the effects of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) during the COVID-19 pandemic using a large-scale experiment,
 showing moderate to no improvements on mental health measures.
 For context,
 their cash interventions transferred $0.75 per day (amounting to a non-discounted total of about $23.3 per month) to the beneficiaries,
 which is much larger than the cash equivalence of our in-kind communication transfers,
 yet we find meaningful improvements on our mental health measures.
 We do not find any impact on food consumption (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:consump_pooled_meta"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

) and therefore no impact is likely to be found on hunger,
 but Banerjee et al.
 (2020) reported modest UBI improvements on food consumption (meat/fish) and hunger.
 Thus,
 it seems communication transfers might yield larger improvements in mental health relative to cash transfers.

The Value of Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
To put our causal estimates into context,
 we consider the cost-effectiveness of a policy that 
\shape italic
provides communication credit to low-income adults for two months
\shape default
.
 To compare the cost of this policy that provides communication transfers with the associated benefits,
 we adapt Hendren and Sprung-Keyser (2020)'s cost-benefit framework that is conducive to empirical welfare analysis.
 Specifically,
 we calculate the marginal value of public funds (MVPF),
 which estimates the ratio of society’s willingness to pay for the provision of communication credit to the net cost to the government (here,
 an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

imagined
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 funder) of implementing this policy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
We estimate society's willingness to pay (MVPF's numerator) to include two main components.
 First,
 is the averted (otherwise) social cost of mental health burden,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

.
 We assume mental health disorders account for 13% of disease burden (Adhvaryu et al.
 2019).
 With a health expenditure per capita of US$78 in Ghana (World Bank 2018),
 and a treatment effect of -10% reduced mental destress rate,
 we conservatively estimate the averted social cost of mental health burden to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 = 0.10x0.13xUS$78=+US$1.014.
 Our 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 estimate is very conservative in comparison to Addo et al.
 (2013) that would have implied a +US$2.68 averted social cost (2.6 times larger).
 Second,
 is the individual beneficiary's willingness to pay for not visiting the hospital or not getting mentally unwell,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

,
 which includes three sub-component estimates:
 (i) out-of-pocket health bill (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}$
\end_inset

 =+US$0.82);
 (ii) travel cost to health centers (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{2}$
\end_inset

=+US$0.203),
 and (iii) lost income from missed work (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{3}$
\end_inset

=+US$11.55).
 Together,
 the MVPF's numerator = 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{3}\eta_{i}$
\end_inset

=US$13.590 for the average treated individual.
 We drop the direct value of the communication subsidy to beneficiaries (+US$7.0) to avoid double counting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Next,
 we estimate the net cost to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

imagined
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 funder or government (MVPF's denominator) to include two main components.
 First,
 is the cost of providing communication transfer for two months,
 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (=+US$7.0).
 Second,
 is the missed communication services tax (CST) revenue if individuals do not communicate or stay connected,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 In Ghana,
 the CST is used to finance the National Youth Employment Programme (NYEP) (
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

20% of the CST) and support other national development activities.
 Using the prevailing 5% CST rate (Ghana Revenue Authority 2020),
 we estimate that the government loses 0.05xUS$7.0= -US$0.35.
 We intentionally over-estimate the total cost of this policy:
 (i) communication is a network good so the ultimate economic incidence of these communication transfers extends to other individuals – others might benefit from receiving mobile phone calls from the treated individual (positive externalities).
 Arguably,
 such positive externalities dominate the potential congestion hassle or traffic on the communication network (negative externalities) (Björkegren 2019 provides an example in Rwanda).
 (ii) We conservatively did not factor in the reduced fiscal cost from less hospital visits due to the reduced likelihood of mental health disorders and/or domestic violence.
 Together,
 the MVPF's denominator = 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

=US$6.65 for the average treated individual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
Finally,
 taking the ratio,
 we estimate a conservative MVPF of providing communication credit to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{13.590}{6.650}=2.044$
\end_inset

.
 This suggest that US$1.0 of spending on this communication credit policy delivers more than US$1.0 in benefits to its beneficiaries.
 Alternatively,
 the MVPF estimate implies that US$1 of expenditure yields US$2 of total benefits,
 and so generates US$1 of net benefits.
 At the aggregate level,
 the policy's total benefit will be US$54,035,343 against a total cost of US$26,441,135.
 Notice that in determining the MVPF,
 we intentionally bias the estimates to understate the benefits and overstate the costs (Appendix section VI.8 contains additional details).

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
The COVID-19 pandemic uncovered a great deal of economic and mental health crises,
 most particularly for those people bound by credit,
 savings and psychological constraints.
 This paper provides new experimental evidence on the impact of providing communication transfers.
 Communication during pandemics meaningfully matters for well-being.
 Our mobile credit interventions led to a notable decrease in unexpected communication constraints;
 individuals were better able to mitigate their inability to meet unexpected communication needs and stay connected.
 As a result,
 the programs led to meaningful well-being improvements,
 particularly on mental health,
 but modestly on domestic violence,
 and null on overall consumption expenditures.
 We present evidence that improvements in both business-related services and social inclusion/ protection are relevant channels explaining the estimated communication impacts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing double

\size large
In terms of policy and design,
 communication initiatives that relax potential communication constraints improve psychological well-being and,
 to a modest degree,
 reduce domestic violence.
 However,
 these programs are more valuable
\shape italic
 
\shape default
if implemented in numerous installments of communication transfers,
 rather than one-time.
 Simple cost-benefit analysis shows that providing communication credit to low-income adults is a cost-effective policy for improving mental health.
 There is almost no work linking mental health and information and communications technology (ICT) (Jensen 2007;
 Blumenstock,
 Eagle and Fafchamps 2016).
 We offer a short-run causal view of what communication does to mental health,
 using evidence from an unexpected pandemic.

Note:
 Figure shows the timetable of baseline and endline data collection activities.
 The various bars reflect the daily number of phone calls or individuals surveyed.
 The baseline involves three panel survey waves (step 0,
 wave I and wave II).
 These waves provide information to determine eligible individuals and to conduct pre-intervention randomization balance tests.
 The endline involves two panel waves (wave III and wave IV) that follow the first round of interventions deployment (Intervention I).
 Intervention I (the lumpsum and the first tranche of credit installment) spans October 27-29,
 2020.
 Intervention II (the second tranche of credit installment) spans November 24-26,
 2020.
 A lockdown was announced on March 30,
 2020 and removed on April 20,
 2020.
 The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ghana as of September 13,
 2020 (the start of our experiment) was 45,434.
 This increased to around 52,738 as of December 9,
 2020 (the end of our experiment).

First,
 is the averted (otherwise) social cost of mental health burden,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

.
 Mental health disorders account for 13% of the overall global disease burden (Collins et al.
 [2011]),
 which is likely higher in low-income countries (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Adhvaryu et al. [2019]"
target "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/701606?mobileUi=0"

\end_inset

);
 we assume 13%.
 Health expenditure per capita in Ghana is US$78 (

LatexCommand href
name "World Bank [2018]"
target "https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD?locations=GH"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 With a treatment effect of -10% reduced mental destress rate (or -25% for severe mental distress;
 we assume -10%),
 we conservatively estimate the averted social cost of mental health burden to be 0.10x0.13xUS$78=+US$1.014.
 This 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

 estimate is very conservative:

\end_inset

 estimate that the average monthly household cost of mental healthcare in Ghana is US$60.24 (i.e.,
 2xUS$60.24=US$120.48 for two months),
 so with a treatment effect of -10% reduced mental destress rate and a national average household size of 4.5 people per household,
 this will imply 0.1xUS$120.48/4.5=+US$2.68 averted social cost,
 which is 2.6 times larger.
 Second,
 is the individual beneficiary's willingness to pay for not visiting the hospital or not getting mentally unwell,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 This includes three sub-components:
 (i) out-of-pocket health bill 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}$

 out-of-pocket health expense is US$63 [

]);
 (ii) travel cost to health centers 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{2}$

 and (iii) lost income from missed work 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{3}$
\end_inset

 (assumed to be only 5% of the average earnings of non-farm enterprises = 0.05xUS$231=+US$11.55 for two months;

We drop the direct value of the communication subsidy to beneficiaries (+US$7.0) to avoid double counting.
 In standard maximization models,
 the willingness to pay would have just been the size of the subsidy

 people are fully optimizing.
 Here,
 it is reasonable to assume that people are not fully optimizing (see e.g.,
 our evidence that the installment program has larger and more sustainable effects compared to the lumpsum,
 with the exception of consumption,
 which may reflect either time inconsistency or social pressure problems from receiving one-time large transfers).
 Given this potential mis-optimization (the envelope theorem does not easily apply and so the benefits the subsidy delivers to people are not already captured by the subsidy),
 the willingness to pay includes the benefits on mental health and its associated cost reductions (

First,
 is the cost of providing communication transfer for two months,

 Second,

 In Ghana,
 the CST is used to finance the National Youth Employment Programme (NYEP) (

 Using the prevailing 5% CST rate (

),
 we estimate that the government loses 0.05xUS$7.0= -US$0.35.
 In computing the net cost to the government of this policy,
 it is important to note that (i) communication is a network good so the ultimate economic incidence of these communication transfers extends to other individuals:
 others might benefit from receiving mobile phone calls from the treated individual (positive externalities) but this might also create congestion hassle or traffic on the communication network (negative externalities).
 We assume (i) and (ii) to be equal.
 If the positive externalities dominate,

 then the total cost of this policy is over-estimated in this dimension.
 Further,
 we conservatively did not factor in the reduced fiscal cost from less hospital visits generally due to the reduced likelihood of mental health disorders.

Taking the ratio,
 we estimate a conservative MVPF of providing communication credit to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{13.590}{6.650}=2.044$

.
 Notice that in determining the MVPF,
 we intentionally bias the estimates to understate the benefits and overstate the costs.
 With a current total population of about 31,732,129 in Ghana,
 an adult population of 18,073,230 (57% of the total population),
 and the poverty rate of our study's sample of adults being 22%,
 the policy's total benefit will be US$54,035,343 (=0.22x18,073,230xUS$13.590) against a total cost of US$26,441,135 (=0.22x18,073,230xUS$6.650).
