*Title: "Distribution of consumption growth among individuals located outside and inside lockdown areas
*Note: Figure plots the distribution (CDF) of consumption growth per week at endline for the different subsamples (lockdown areas vs non-lockdown areas). Observations are at the individual level. Median (mean) percent consumption growth is -13% (-45%) for individuals in lockdown areas and -8% (-27%) for those in non-lockdown areas. From a Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (KS) test for the equality of distributions, p-value equal 0.020 (for equality test, we trimmed the individual consumption growth outcome at the 5% level). Equality tests reject the null that the distributional pairs are equal.
